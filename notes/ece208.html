    <h2 id="propositional-logic">Propositional logic</h2>
    <p>
      Propositional logic is a set of rules used to reason about the truth or
      falsity of statements from base assumptions. Originally developed to
      formalize a good argument, it can be used as a foundation for reasoning
      and proof. A strong proof requires a set of correct assumptions, a set of
      meaningful constraints formed by propositions and predicates, and a set of 
      tactics, or proving techniques, to establish the consistency of our system
      and whether it will behave as we intend.
    </p>

    <div class="definition">
      A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.
    </div>
    <div class="definition">
      An environment is a set of values, either true or false, given to each atomic proposition
      so that propositions can be evaluated.
    </div>


    <h2 id="predicates">Predicates and quantifiers</h2>
    <div class="definition">
      A predicate is a function that returns a proposition.
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      Think of typed predicate logic as a programming language for reasoning
      about objects. <a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Predicates work with types and quantifiers to make statements about
      objects, groups of objects, attributes of objects, and relationships
      between objects.
    </p>
    <div class="definition">
      A quantifier is a logical operator that binds variables to a predicate.
      They are used to express statements about objects in a domain.
    </div>
    <p>
      There are three types of quantifiers: the universal quantifier
      &#8220;\(\forall\)&#8221;,
      the existential quantifier &#8220;\(\exists\)&#8221;, and the uniqueness quantifier
      &#8220;\(\exists!\)&#8221;. The universal quantifier asserts that a predicate is true
      for every objects in a domain, while the existential quantifier asserts
      that a predicate is true for at least one object in a domain. Finally,
      the uniqueness quantifier asserts that there is exactly one object in a
      domain that satisfies the predicate. Each quantifier must always be
      followed by a variable with a type and then a predicate.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-lean">-- here are some types
variable (person : Type)
variable (liquid : Type)

-- this is a predicate!
variable (drinks : person -> liquid -> Prop)
variable (water : liquid)

-- now we can say things like...
\forall (p : person), drinks p water -- everyone drinks water
\exists (p : person), drinks p water -- someone drinks water
\forall (p : person), \exists (l : liquid), drinks p l -- everyone drinks something
\exists! (p : person), drinks p water -- only one person drinks water</code></pre>
    <p>
      Of course, these statements do not make sense except when they are taken
      as an <em>assumption</em>, <em>goal</em>, or subgoal in a proof;
      in other words, they must be considered in the context of their <em>environment</em>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="quantifier-scope">Quantifier scope</h3>
    <p>
      When we write statements with quantifiers, we must distinguish between
      <em>bound</em> and <em>free</em> variables. A bound variable is within
      the scope of a quantifier for that variable, while a free one
      is not bound by any quantifier. But how can we tell if a variable is within
      the scope of any quantifier?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, each quantifier introduced has a scope: from where it is introduced
      to the end of the statement or an unmatched right parenthesis. Any variable
      that is introduced by a quantifier is bound by that quantifier.
      <em>Well-formed formulas</em> (wff) are closed if they have no free variables.
      Therefore, careful use of parentheses is necessary to ensure that the
      scope of each quantifier is clear.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-lean">-- Here is a well-formed formula
\forall (x : Nat), \exists (y : Nat), x < y
-- Here is a poorly-formed formula
\forall (x : Nat), (\exists (y : Nat), x < y) -> y > x -- outer y is free</code></pre>
    <p>
      The outer \(y\) has no meaning because it is not bound by any quantifier.
    </p>

    <h2 id="case-splitting">Case splitting</h2>
    <div class="definition">
      Case splitting is when we decompose a proof into multiple independent
      cases. In the syntax of the course, we use the <code>Cases</code> rule
      to do so.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
    </div>

    <pre><code class="language-lean">Var (x : Nat)
|- P
By Cases x < 10, x >= 10 ∧ even x, x >= 10 ∧ odd x;
{
  Subproof 1: "completeness"

  Subproof 2: "case 1"
    Asm 2/1: x < 10
    -- Continue subproof
  Subproof 3: "case 2"
    Asm 3/1: x >= 10 ∧ even x
    -- Continue subproof
  Subproof 4: "case 3"
    Asm 4/1: x >= 10 ∧ odd x
    -- Continue subproof
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      The goal is to first prove that the list of cases itself is complete and
      covers all possibilities; then, that for each of the subcases, prove our
      original goal. Cases may overlap. To justify that a trivial set of cases is
      complete, we may use the <code>Arith</code> or <code>Logic</code> tactics.
    </p>

    <h2 id="induction">Natural number induction</h2>
    <p>
      Induction is a proof technique that is used to prove a property for all
      natural numbers. The idea is to prove the property for the base case, and
      then prove that if the property holds for \(n\), it also holds for \(n+1\).
      Our goal is therefore \(\forall(n : \mathbb{N}),\ p(n)\) for some predicate
      \(p\).
    </p>
    <p>
      Natural number induction may only be applied to goals where the
      <em>outermost operator is a universal quantifier</em> over a variable
      of type \(\mathbb{N}\).
    </p>
    <div class="definition">
      Natural induction is a proof technique that is used to prove a predicate
      holds for all natural numbers. It has
      <ul>
        <li>A goal, \(\forall(n : \mathbb{N}),\ p(n)\)</li>
        <li>A proof rule, <code>InductNat</code></li>
        <li>A base case has no new assumptions and the goal \(p(0)\)</li>
        <li>An inductive case with assumption that for an arbitrary \(n\),
          \(p(n)\) holds, and the goal is \(p(n+1)\)</li>
      <ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      We can also distinguish between induction, <em>strong induction</em>,
      and <em>positive number induction</em>.
    </p>
    <div class="definition">
      Strong induction is induction where the inductive case not only assumes
      that the property holds for \(n\), but also for all \(m \leq n\).

      <ul>
        <li>Goal is \(\forall(n : \mathbb{N}),\ p(n)\)</li>
        <li>Proof rule is <code>InductStrongNat</code></li>

        <li>Inductive case assumes that given arbitrary \(n\),
          \(\forall(m\le n), p(m)\), and the goal is \(p(n+1)\)</li>
    </div>
    <p>
      In general, inductive proofs are used to prove things about objects that
      have recursive definitions.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      When verifying a function, the structure of the function usually guides the
      structure of the proof. If the function recurses on its first argument,
      then induct on the variable that is the first argument to the function.

      Choosing between weak/normal induction and strong induction for math
      proofs is difficult. Try normal induction first, then switch to strong
      induction if needed. There will not be any “just math” proofs on the final.
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="induction-list">List induction</h2>
    <p>
      List induction can be used to prove some property for all lists. The idea
      is to prove the property for an empty list, and then prove that if the
      property holds for an arbitrary list, it also holds for the list with an
      additional element. Our goal is therefore
      \(\forall(xs : \text{List } Ty),\ P(xs)\).

    <p>
      In the above, the notation <code>P(x :: xs)</code> refers to the predicate
      applied to the list with new element <code>x</code> "pushed" onto it.
      The push operation appends a new element to the front of the list.
      Here is how we "splice" two lists together in a formal way.

      Let's prove that if \(xs\) and \(ys\) are lists, then

      In this section, we will first define what a graph is using the graph
      type, and then
      constructively place constraints on this definition to define directed
      acyclic graphs, trees, and binary trees.
    </p>
    <div class="definition">
      A graph is a pair \(G = (V, E)\) where \(V\) is a set of vertices of type

    <p>
      An edge is an ordered or unordered pair of natural numbers representing
      two vertices and their connection.

      If the graph is <em>directed</em>, then the edges are ordered pairs, with
      the first element being the source and the second element being the
      destination. If the graph is <em>undirected</em>, then the edges are
      unordered pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we can construct the necessary propositions to perform strong induction
      with graphs. Remember that strong induction requires that an "empty graph"
      is defined, and that the inductive case assumes that the property holds for
      all strict subsets of the graph. We can define strict subsets for vertices
      or edges.

      Note that we distinguish between strict subsets and non-strict subsets

      A tree is a graph with a unique vertex (the root) such that for each vertex,

    <p>
      Now there are some new things to formalize. What is a path, for
      example? We can define a path as a list of vertices, with
      the first vertex the root and the last vertex the destination. We can
      check if this path exists by making sure that each pair of adjacent
      vertices is an edge in the graph.

      The uniqueness quantification, &#8220;\(\exists!\)&#8221;, means that

      A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph with no directed cycles.
