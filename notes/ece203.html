    <h2 id="probability-axioms">The fundamental axioms</h2>
    <div class="definition">
      A probability space is a triplet \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P})\).
      \(\Omega\) is a nonempty set called the <em>sample space</em>,
      \(\mathcal{F}\) is a set of subsets of \(\Omega\) called <em>events</em>,
      and the component \(\mathcal{P}\) is a <em>probability measure</em> on
      \(\mathcal{F}\).
      <span class="sidenote">
        A probability measure is a measure, which is a function satisfying
        certain properties. We call it a probability measure because we define
        a set of additional axioms this function must satisfy.
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="definition">
      The first component \(\Omega\) is a nonempty set called the <em>sample
      space</em>. Each element \(\omega \in \Omega\) is called an <em>outcome</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="definition">
      Events \(A_i\in\mathcal{F}\) are mutually exclusive, also known as disjoint,
      if \(A_i\cap A_j = \emptyset\) for all \(i\ne j\).
    </div>
    <p>
      We can now define the function that assigns probabilities to events
      in the sample space. This function must satisfy the axioms of probability
      theory.
    </p>
    <div class="definition">
      A probability measure is any measure \(P\) on \(\mathcal{F}\)
      that satisfies the axioms of probability theory:

      <ol>
        <li>\(P(A) \ge 0\, \forall A\in\mathcal{F}\)</li>
        <li>\(P(\Omega) = 1\)</li>
        <li>If \(A_1, A_2, \ldots\) are disjoint events, then
          \(P(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i)\)</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p>
      The probability measure assigns a real number to each event that
      represents how likely it is to happen. This is called the <em>probability</em>
      of the event. For the math to make sense, this number must be nonnegative.
      The probability of the entire sample space is 1, so any event that has
      probability 1 is certain to happen. We can also derive more properties from
      these axioms. For any subsets \(A, B, C\in\mathcal{F}\):
      <span class="sidenote">
        \(P\) did not have to be defined this way. The only
        requirement is that it is a &#8220;positive continuous monotonic function.&#8221;
        An alternate definition could have been from infinity (impossible)
        <em>down</em> to one (certain)! <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
      </span>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>\(A\subseteq B \implies P(A) \le P(B)\)</li>
      <li>\(P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)\)</li>
      <li>\(P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)\)</li>
      <li>\(P(\emptyset) = 0\)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="random-variables">Random variables</h2>
    <div class="definition">
      A random variable is a function \(X:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}\) that is
      \(\mathcal{F}\) measurable.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>

      <span class="sidenote">
        This means that for any number \(c\),
        \(\{\omega\in\Omega: X(\omega) \le c\}\in\mathcal{F}\)
      </span>
    </div>
    <p>
      If the sample space is finite or countably infinite, \(\mathcal{F}\) is
      most often defined to be the power set of \(\Omega\), and any function from
      \(\Omega\) to \(\mathbb{R}\) will be \(\mathcal{F}\) measurable and thus a
      random variable.
      Therefore, for practical purposes we may assume that any function that
      maps events (which have corresponding probabilities) to real numbers is a
      random variable.
    <p>
    <p>
      This is extremely useful, because we can now give values to events to
      model real-world phenomena. For example, we can define one random variable
      \(X\) that represents the number of heads in a series of coin flips to talk
      about the probability, instead of using the events themselves.
